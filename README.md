# Synaudit

[![Synaudit Go CI/CD](https://github.com/gaetangr/synaudit/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gaetangr/synaudit/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A fast and user-friendly security auditing tool for Synology NAS systems built in Go.

## Why Synaudit?

While I love my Synology NAS, the DSM interface can be slow and cumbersome for quick security audits. I found myself constantly jumping between multiple services and applications just to get a comprehensive understanding of my system's health and security status.

Although Synology provides some built-in tools, none offer the speed or comprehensive bundling of all the security checks I needed. That's why I created Synaudit.

### Key Benefits:
- **Fast**: Built with Go for lightning-fast performance
- **User-friendly**: Designed for both technical and non-technical users
- **Comprehensive**: All security checks in one place
- **Community-driven**: Implements best practices discussed in the Synology community
- **No dependencies**: Single binary, no installation required
- **Scalable**: The code architecture is easy to expand for futur checks

## Features

### Current Security Checks

#### User & Authentication
- **Admin Account Status**: Verifies if the default admin account is properly disabled
- **2FA Enforcement**: Checks if two-factor authentication is enforced for admin accounts
- **Password Policy**: Comprehensive analysis of password strength requirements
  - Minimum length enforcement
  - Mixed case requirements
  - Numeric character requirements
  - Special character requirements
  - Username exclusion in passwords
  - Common password blocking
  - Password history enforcement
  - Password expiration policies

#### Network & Firewall
- **Firewall Status**: Verifies if the system firewall is enabled
- **Port Security**: Scans for open ports and identifies security risks
  - SSH on default port (22)
  - Telnet service detection (critical risk)
  - FTP service detection (unencrypted)
  - SMB/NetBIOS exposure
  - RDP exposure
  - DSM HTTP vs HTTPS usage
  - RPC service exposure

#### Remote Access & Services
- **QuickConnect**: Detects if QuickConnect service is enabled (security risk)
- **Terminal Services**: Checks SSH and Telnet configuration
  - SSH default port usage
  - Telnet enablement (critical security issue)
- **FTP Security**: Analyzes FTP service configuration
  - Unencrypted FTP detection
  - TLS/SSL encryption status
- **Auto-Block Policy**: Verifies brute force protection settings

#### Package Security
- **Installed Packages Analysis**: Reviews installed packages for security risks
  - Development tools in production (Node.js, PHP, Perl)
  - Obsolete packages (Python2, old PHP versions)
  - High-risk packages (ContainerManager, DownloadStation)
  - Unnecessary services identification

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `.env` file for easy configuration
- **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Utilizes 40+ Synology API endpoints

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your Synology NAS details:
```env
SYNOLOGY_HOST=https://your-synology-ip:port/webapi/entry.cgi
```

### 2. Run the Audit
```bash
go run .
```

Or build and run:
```bash
go build .
./synaudit
```

### Current Features
- **Admin Account Security**: Default admin account status verification
- **2FA Enforcement**: Two-factor authentication policy checks
- **Password Policy**: Comprehensive password strength analysis
- **Firewall Status**: System firewall configuration verification
- **Network Security**: Port scanning and service exposure detection
- **Terminal Services**: SSH/Telnet security configuration
- **FTP Security**: File transfer protocol security analysis
- **QuickConnect**: Remote access service security assessment
- **Package Security**: Installed package risk analysis
- **Auto-Block**: Brute force protection verification
- **Comprehensive API**: 40+ Synology API endpoints coverage

### Planned Features
- **Certificate Management**: SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Update Management**: DSM and package update status
- **Backup Verification**: Backup task configuration analysis
- **Share Security**: Shared folder permission auditing
- **Log Analysis**: Security event log monitoring
- **VPN Configuration**: VPN service security assessment
- **Export Reports**: JSON, HTML, and PDF report generation
- **Scheduled Audits**: Automated recurring security checks

## Requirements

- Synology NAS with DSM 6.0 or higher
- Admin privileges on your Synology NAS
- Go 1.19+ (for building from source)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary
```bash
# Coming soon
wget https://github.com/gaetangr/synaudit/releases/latest/synaudit
chmod +x synaudit
```

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaetangr/synaudit.git
cd synaudit
go build -o synaudit .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run security audit
./synaudit

# Example output:
üîç SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
üìÖ Checked at: 2025-07-24 15:30:45
üìä Total issues: 3

[1] SSH running on default port
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  SSH on port 22 is heavily targeted by automated attacks
    üí° Change SSH port to a high random port (e.g., 22000-65000)

[2] Password minimum length too short
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Current minimum password length is 8 characters, should be at least 10
    üí° Increase minimum password length to 10+ characters

[3] QuickConnect is enabled
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  QuickConnect exposes your NAS to the internet through Synology's relay servers
    üí° Disable QuickConnect and use VPN for remote access instead
```

## Security & Privacy

**Your data is safe:**
- All network calls are made locally to your NAS IP
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No analytics or telemetry
- 100% open source and auditable

**Note**: To perform security checks, Synaudit requires a user with admin privileges on your Synology NAS.

## Technical Details

### The Synology API

Synology provides an API for various system operations, but official documentation is limited. The available guide ([Synology Web API Guide](https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/DG/DSM_Login_Web_API_Guide/2)) provides basic insights.

Through reverse engineering the DSM interface, I discovered that using the compound request method with proper session cookies allows for much faster and more efficient API consumption.
